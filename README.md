## Introduction

<p>Welcome to the Philosophers project! This project aims to simulate the dining philosophers problem, which is an interesting synchronization problem in computer science. The project provides a solution that demonstrates the problem and showcases various synchronization techniques to avoid deadlocks and resource contention.</p>

2. Change Directory
cd philosophers

3. Run the Project
make
 
4 . The Syntaaxx 
**./philosophers [number_of_philosophers] [time_to_die] [time_to_eat] [time_to_sleep] [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]**

## Usage

Replace the arguments in square brackets with your desired values. Here's a brief explanation of each argument:

**number_of_philosophers:** The total number of philosophers in the simulation.
**time_to_die:** The time in milliseconds after which a philosopher dies if they haven't started eating.
**time_to_eat:** The time in milliseconds that a philosopher takes to finish eating.
**time_to_sleep:** The time in milliseconds that a philosopher spends sleeping between meals.
**number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat:** The number of times each philosopher must eat before the simulation ends.
